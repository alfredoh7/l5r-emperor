"""Build Personality wave 19 (issue #276 follow-up): Tsuruchi Yakusho, the first card to exercise
the general "after you announce an action" Reaction primitive -- offered only when the about-to-
execute ability is classified Ranged by the existing AttackKind() lookup, granting the reacting
Personality immunity to Attack-strength reduction for the remainder of that specific Attack's own
resolution. See MatchEngine.ResolveOrDeferAnnounceReaction and MatchState.RangedAttackStrengthReductionImmune.

Same discipline as every other wave: curated Effect/Ability mapping, hand-verified against the
card's own scanned image, never inferred from prose.

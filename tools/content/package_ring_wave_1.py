"""Build Ring wave 1 (issue #194): the first CardType.Ring cards, and the first real cards
exercising the Rings concept (recruitment-as-granted-Additional-Battle-Action, Enlightenment
victory). All seven wired Rings so far: Air, Water, Void, False Air, False Water (unblocked once
their scans became available locally, issue #196, via the WebP working-copy pipeline, issue #200),
plus Earth and Fire (revalidated once their own scans became available -- their earlier blocker
notes were themselves based on mismatched/incomplete scraped text, the same class of problem issue
#195 flagged for Ring of Fire specifically; resolved by reading the actual scans directly).

Same discipline as every other package_*.py: curated Effect/Ability mapping, hand-verified against
each card's own scanned image, never inferred from prose.

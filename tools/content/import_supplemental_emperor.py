"""Import the Emperor Edition cards that the Age of Conquest (Emperor) legality query leaves out.

Oracle's Emperor legality list omits cards it records as banned, so a handful of cards with an explicit Emperor Edition printing (issue #812) never reached
content/oracle/emperor-catalogue.json, the card library or the deck pool. content/oracle/emperor-edition/coverage-review.json names them; their raw Oracle records are
kept in content/oracle/emperor-edition/catalogue.json. This writes them, in the same schema as emperor-catalogue.json, to content/oracle/emperor-supplemental-catalogue.json.

Mendon ruled (R-040, 2026-10-10) that all seven are playable once wired: each keeps its source legality labels and any ban note as DATA ONLY, never shown in game.
Offline; standard library only.

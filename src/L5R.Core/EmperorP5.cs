// ISSUE #503, PASS GROUP P5: zones, rulebook-action changes, created/copied cards, granted abilities, provenance records, hidden information. Every card was read letter by letter against its scan
// (the scan is authoritative where the catalogue's Oracle text differs; each difference is noted at the card).
//
// New primitives (each checked against docs/rules/EMPEROR_EDITION_CORE_RULES.md; none conflicts with it):
//   * "WAS NOT IN PLAY WHEN THIS COMBAT SEGMENT BEGAN" (Headbutt, a PROVENANCE record): as each battle's Combat Segment begins (the Engage window closes, or engagement opens none) the engine notes
//     which cards are in play and the event number it began at (EmperorP5State.SegmentInPlay / SegmentStartEvent). A card was not in play then when it is not in that note, or when it has entered
//     play since (a "cardEnteredPlay", "cardCreated", "reserveRecruited" or "equipped" event for it after the segment began: a card that left and came back is a new entry).
//   * "YOU HAVE TAKEN A [KEYWORD] ACTION THIS PHASE" (Daigotsu Yutaka's Dark Virtue record): counted where an action's effects resolve (RunAbilityEffects), so a wholly negated action does not count
//     (Mendon's ruling), per player and per printed phase instance (PrintedPhases.Instance).
//   * A PERFORMER-SIDE ACTION BAN BY KEYWORD, and one BY ARMY FORCE (Yutaka: "may not perform Bushido Virtue actions"; Raido no Oni: "may not perform Battle actions while your current army has
//     higher total Force than the current enemy army"): read in ValidateAbility for the card that performs the action by the printed rules (ActionPerformerPerRules), armies totalled as the
//     battle would resolve them (ArmyForces).
//   * AN ITEM USED FROM A HAND (Tsubute: "destroy this card or discard it from your hand"): its second way to pay is a second catalog entry sharing the printed action's use, whose source is the
//     Item in its player's hand (P5SourceZoneAllows, AbilitySourceZoneAllows' hook) and whose cost discards it.
//   * CONDITIONAL PLAYER ABILITIES GRANTED BY A CARD IN PLAY OR AN EVENT (The Bite of Winter, Economic Repercussions: "all players have the ability ..."; Starting on the Path, Never Enough Soldiers:
//     "until your Nth turn from now begins, you have the ability ..."): player abilities listed only while the granting card is in play (Assault in the Jungle's PlayerAbilityDormant shape), the
//     Events staying in Zone.EventInPlay with ExpiresAtTurnsTaken.
//   * EQUIP FROM A DISCARD PILE (Seek the Stain, Never Enough Soldiers: rulebook-action changes): the Equip rulebook action's own shapes (Limited: a Personality at home; Battle: a Spell to an
//     unbowed opposed Shugenja) with the attachment taken from the discard pile, paying all costs, any number of times per turn.
//   * STATIC -1F FOR EVERY PERSONALITY AND FOLLOWER (The Bite of Winter) and -2 GOLD COST FOR OTHER PLAYERS' PERSONALITIES AND FOLLOWERS IN PLAY (Economic Repercussions): P5Force / P5GoldCost hooks.

// ======================================================================================================================================================================================
// STRATEGY WAVE 109 (issue #622): ten Strategies carrying a Twenty Festivals label whose earliest Emperor-era printing is wired from its OWN scan (Aftermath, Coils of Madness, Gates of Chaos,
// Emperor Edition), with the PRINTED wording rather than Oracle's later template.
//   * AWED WITNESS (657): "Iaijutsu Battle: Choose your performing unbowed Personality and target an enemy Personality: Your Personality duels the target. Bow the duel's loser. The duel's
//     winner's controller may create a 2F/2C/2PH Samurai Personality with that player's Clan alignment on his side of the current battlefield." Reckless Duel's challenge (not refusable: the scan
//     says "duels"), the loser bowed, and -- before the outcome applies, like the delay decisions -- the winner's controller is asked whether to create Witness (oracle-l5r-10018, Emperor Edition's
//     Proxy scan, 2F/2C/2PH Samurai, with its creator's Clan alignment): the answer is an Either/Or (the generic presentation) and the duel then resolves again with it. A tie has no winner, so no question.
//   * A WARRIOR'S BRUTALITY (10927): "Battle: Give your target opposed Personality +3F." is exactly Crushing Strength's action (crushing-force): reused unchanged.
//   * ABSOLUTION (10928): "Interrupt: Negate an Event's effects." plays like a Reaction before the Event resolves (Emperor Edition rules: an Interrupt is a Reaction to "before an action's effects
//     resolve"), Forging Destiny's window ("p3BeforeEventReaction", EmperorP3Windows.cs). Kharmic is the engine's own keyword action (kharmic-discard).
//   * BREAKING THE RHYTHM (10931): "As a Focus Effect, if you win this duel, gain 1 Honor and give the winner +1F." and "Absent Battle: Negate a target Personality's current Force bonuses or
//     penalties (you choose)." The choice is made by the action played (one ability for each, as Creating Order's two halves), and negates what is on the Personality when it resolves: his Force
//     modifiers and tokens (a later bonus or penalty is not "current" and is not touched).
//   * DEATH OF THE WINDS (10544) / DIRECTING THE BATTLE (10935): deck searches for a non-Unique Battle Strategy. Directing the Battle's "if there are any enemy units" is its entry condition
//     (Your Clan Needs You!'s shape); Death of the Winds also needs "your unbowed Tactician" as its target and grants an additional action scoped to the card it found ("to play it").
//   * FEIGN DEATH (2503): printed as a Reaction "After the resolution of an action or a battle that destroyed a performing Personality you own": two Reactions (an action's and a battle's
//     resolution) sharing one use; its target is the destroyed Personality, who must be one that very resolution destroyed (Mendon's R-022 reading of the trigger).
//   * GRASP THE SWORDS (10940): +2F/+2C to your target Personality with a Weapon, and an additional action if he is a Kensai.
//   * HIDDEN STOREHOUSE OF HOUSE RAFIQ (10732): "If you (after playing this Strategy) have fewer cards in your hand than each other player, draw two cards."
//   * HOLD THE WALLS (10941): a Terrain; "Attacking Personalities and Followers have -1F" at its battlefield (TerrainForceAdjustment) and its Battle play replaces a Terrain already there
//     (Looting the Ruins' shape).
//   * IVORY MAGISTRATE OUTPOST (10734): Open: straighten your target Magistrate; Battle: straighten your target Personality.

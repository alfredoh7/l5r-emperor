// Issue #738, wave batch 7: the turn-boundary, rule-flag and Events-Phase cards, wired on the merged P4 (turn begins, durations, player grants, standing rules, AddTurnScopedRule), P13 (rule flags,
// RuleFlags.cs) and P6 (the turned-face-up fact) primitives, with P7's player-level negation watch, P10's Clan-alignment grant and the existing forced-discard queue. Every legality and every effect is
// decided in Core. Ability ids are "w738-". Readings for Mendon to confirm or correct are in docs/decisions/2026-10-08-wave-batch-7-turn-boundaries-and-rule-flags.md. Waves are those of
// tools/content/package_wave_738.py.
//
// THE SCANS DO NOT PRINT THE P5 CLAUSE. The catalogue (Oracle) text of A Dangerous Game, An Empire of Madness, Open Recruitment and Rejected Mediation opens "After you reveal cards in your Provinces at
// the start of your turn, if this Event is face-up in one of them, ..."; the period scans print only the effect, so each is an ordinary Event that resolves when it is revealed (the P5 "stays face up and
// fires every turn" flag is not used). Open Recruitment's and Rejected Mediation's durations follow the scans too.

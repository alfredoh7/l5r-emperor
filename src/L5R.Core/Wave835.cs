//
//   A Cleansing Breath       "Battle/Open: Target your Personality at any location. He centers himself. Negate other players' cards' effects that prevent him assigning, moving, or performing actions. If he is
//                            a Kensai, straighten his unit."   "He centers himself." is flavor text and does nothing. A Prevention immunity for the turn; the Kensai's unit straightens.
//   Imperial Deployment      "Open: Choose your performing Personality: ... Negate other players' cards' effects that prevent him assigning. After the next time this turn an attack is declared, straighten
//                            his unit."   An AssignPrevention immunity (assigning only: movement stays barred) and a mandatory straighten when the attack is declared this turn.
//   Warded Premises          "Before this battle's resolution: Negate all Force bonuses from actions to cards at this battlefield. / Battle: Even if you control no units at the current battlefield, if there
//                            is no Terrain in play there: Put this card into play there."   Only the bonuses actions gave (not permanent ones, attachments' or tokens').
//   Duty Over All Things     "Battle, :gstar:: If he would be opposed, Recruit your target performing discarded Yojimbo, paying 3 less Gold if you control a Courtier or Shugenja."   A discarded (not dead)
//                            Yojimbo, recruited at the current battlefield when an enemy Personality stands there.
//   Pierce the Tapestry      "You may include up to seven copies of this card in your deck. / Battle: Choose your performing unbowed Monk and target an enemy Personality or Follower: Give it -3F. If it has no
//                            attachments and you have played two or more other Pierce the Tapestry this battle, destroy it. If this did not destroy it, you may take an additional Battle action to play a
//                            Pierce the Tapestry."   A per-player, per-battle count of plays and an additional action scoped to the ability. Oracle of the Void prints the name "Pierce the Tapestery".
//   The Heavens' Blessing    "Open: Until the game ends, a player must pay 2 Gold to draw a card from effects of his own Strategies during an Action Phase. / Open: No player can gain Honor in Action Phases (this
//                            turn)."   A game-long flag; every card a player's own Strategy would draw in an Action Phase is owed, and each owed card is its own 2 Gold payment (a window after the action).
//   Unbearable Weight        "Limited, :g4:: Discard the top card of a Fate deck. You may target a Personality and give him a Chi penalty equal to the card's Focus Value. If this destroyed the target, his
//                            controller puts this Strategy in his hand."   The card is controlled by whoever holds it and returns to its owner's discard pile when it leaves play.
//   Merchant Patronage       "Political Interrupt: If the action is on another player's Holding, you choose who gains or loses any Honor from it. If you control a Courtier, you may bow him to increase the gain or
//                            loss by 1."   A Reaction in the existing before-Honor-change window (EmperorRulingR4Honor.cs), on a change an action of another player's Holding makes.
//   Blood of Isawa's Tribe   "After this Spell attaches, choose an element keyword (Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Void) in this Shugenja's keywords or text. While this Spell remains attached, replace all
//                            instances of that keyword on this Shugenja with a different element keyword that you choose now."   A mandatory trait: a two-step decision after the Spell attaches (the Shugenja's
//                            element keywords, then the five elements; the same element asks for a confirmation), with no Reaction window and no pass. P10's ReplaceElementKeyword does the replacing.
//   Revelations              "After you reveal cards in your Provinces at the start of your turn, if this Event is face-up in one of them, show the top five cards of your Dynasty deck. Choose another player who may
//                            discard one of the cards, put the rest back in any order, and refill this Province face-up."   A province-reveal Event (P5): the five cards are shown to both players, the other
//                            player may discard one (the shown-choice panel), its owner arranges the rest (the look panel), and the Event's Province refills face up.
//   The Empire's Foe Exposed "Limited: Target two Unique Personalities in play, exactly one of which is yours. Your Personality challenges the other Personality. Destroy the duel's loser."   Mendon: an Event
//                            that opens a duel when it resolves in the Events Phase; it does nothing unless each player has a Unique Personality in play; a player with exactly one is not asked.
//   The Egg of P'an Ku - exp "Limited: Bow one of your target unbowed Personalities. Remove this Item from the game. Create a copy of a target Personality, ignoring costs and restrictions. Bow the second target.
//                            He will not straighten, attack, or defend until after your next turn begins. Remove the copy from the game after your next turn begins."   Mendon: the Egg's controller controls the
//                            copy, which enters play in his home; the copied Personality (the second target, whoever's he is) is bowed and may not straighten, attack or defend until then.

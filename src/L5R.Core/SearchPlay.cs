// ISSUE #667, CLUSTER "SEARCH-PLAY" (personality-wave-125: Gozu, Hyobuko, Masaya; item-wave-43: Heart of Fudo - exp2, The Sacred Rosary of the Constrictors, The Topaz Armor - exp).
// Every card was read letter by letter against its scan. Mendon's rulings are built as stated; the readings built in beyond them are in docs/decisions/2026-10-05-667-search-play.md.
//
// New primitives (each in its own SearchPlay*.cs file; the shared engine files carry short, commented hooks into them):
//   * A PLAY OWED AFTER A SEARCH (SearchPlayGozu.cs). A search whose finding must then be played ("search ..., show it, then take an additional Battle action to play it, if legal; if not,
//     discard it"): the found card goes to the hand (SearchEffect.ToHand), and when the search finishes the engine asks QueryActions whether the player could play it now. If so he is granted a
//     MANDATORY additional action scoped to it and the play is OWED (MatchState.SearchPlayOwes): the pass, the decline of the additional action and every other action are refused (and listed
//     disabled) until the card has been played (Mendon's ruling: "the terrain play is mandatory and the player may not pass"). If not, the card is discarded.
//   * A SEARCH THAT PUTS A CELESTIAL INTO PLAY WITH NO PROVINCE (SearchPlayRosary.cs): SearchEffect "sp-celestial-into-play", through the shared Celestial entry (MatchEngine.EnterCelestialPlay);
//     the place searched (the Dynasty deck or the Dynasty discard pile) is remembered on the search, and a discard-pile source removes the Item from the game.
//   * A TWO-OF-ELEVEN KEYWORD CHOICE AS AN ENTRY TRAIT (SearchPlayTopaz.cs): a queued Event-choice style decision asked twice, whose pair is granted to the wielder like the Spirit cards' grants
//     (GrantDuration.Attachment, so it ends when the Armor leaves play for any reason, and follows the Armor on a transfer).
//   * A PROVINCE RECRUIT AS AN OPEN ACTION (SearchPlayMasaya.cs): Rise of the Dark Naga's shared recruit entry sequence, taken by the face-up province card itself, and the return of the
//     Personality to the top of his owner's Dynasty deck as the turn ends (SearchPlayReturns).
//   * A PERSONALITY DISCARDED FROM PLAY AS A COST (Hyobuko), and a wielder-dependent attach price (Heart of Fudo to Hyobuko, The Topaz Armor to a Topaz Champion).

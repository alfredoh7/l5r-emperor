// Primitive P11 (issues #668/#684): a card-restriction store and generalised target bars.
//
//   * A CARD RESTRICTION says what a card (or a province, or a player) may not do or is allowed to do: "may not attack", "will not attach Followers or Items", "may not be assigned to the same
//     battlefield as that Personality", "cards will not enter play from this province", "may assign even if bowed". It is either STORED (a record in MatchState.Restrictions with a duration) or
//     STATIC (registered once for a card definition in CardRestrictionCatalog, or yielded live by an EngineHooks.CardRestrictions callback, and read while the card is in play).
//   * A TARGET-BAR RULE generalises TargetBar (TargetBars.cs): a bar on one card (or on the unit it heads) against the actions of an ACTOR described by an ActorSpec (a card, the unit of a card, its
//     controller, other players, an action keyword), with a duration; a FORCED rule says the matching actors MUST target the card when it is a legal target. Static bars come from
//     CardRestrictionCatalog the same way.
//
// "May not" removes the option (the offered lists and the validators read the same predicate); "will not" lets the action be taken and the effect fails (a challenge that is not issued, a card that is
// not dishonored). Every consult reads ONE predicate in this file, so the offered lists and the validators can never disagree.
//
// Consult points (one line each in the shared files): MatchEngine.Assign and the offered attack/defend units (RestrictionBarsAssignment, RequireRestrictionPairsMayAssign, MayAssignBowed), Dueling.IssueChallenge
// (RestrictionBarsChallenge), AttachmentAllowed/AttachmentLegalTarget (RestrictionRefusesAttachment), Dishonor (RestrictionRefusesDishonor), QuotePurchase/QuoteOverlay (ProvinceEntryLockError, which every
// province entry -- Recruit, Reserve, overlay, ability recruit -- reads), ResolveCelestial (RestrictionDelaysCelestial), StartTurn (RestrictionsTurnBegin), RequireNotBarredFromTargeting
// (RequireRestrictionRulesAllow) and the two performer switches of the ability validator/lister (WithActWhileBowed).

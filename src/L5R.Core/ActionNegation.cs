// (Champion of Thunder's "all" on one card, Rokai's destroy, Tamoko's move) live in MatchState.NegatedEffects and are unchanged.
//
// The deferred action (MatchState.PendingNegatableAbility) has announced but not resolved. Negating it does not stop it from having been
// TAKEN: what it costs is still paid (Mendon's ruling, issue #351: a negated action pays ALL its costs unless the card says otherwise), its use is
// still spent (once per turn), a Strategy still leaves the hand, an Additional Action grant is still consumed or forfeited, and priority still
// passes -- only its effects do not happen, whichever they were and whoever they reached (bow, move, destroy, Force, Honor, a draw, a choice for
// another player...). Every cost is paid here, in ONE place: the Gold cost (PayForAbility), a chosen CostOption, the Imperial Favor discard, and
// the ability's declared Costs (AbilityCosts.cs: bow, discard, remove from the game, sacrifice, destroy a token, return to a deck, lose Honor) --
// the same list RunAbilityEffects pays for an action that is not negated. A cost an ability still pays inside its own effects (the few the
// decision document lists by id, whose cost is conditional or feeds its effect) is not paid when negated. Payment is ATOMIC: see below.

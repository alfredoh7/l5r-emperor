// ======================================================================================================================================================================================
// EMPEROR EDITION THREE-SCANS PASS (issue #496): the three cards whose scans Mendon supplied after the remaining-cards pass left them unwired -- Honor Never Falls (Forgotten Legacy, a Strategy,
// strategy-wave-65), Kurohito's Perfection (Torn Asunder, a Celestial, celestial-wave-9) and Makito (Embers of War, a Personality, personality-wave-79). Each was read letter by letter against its scan.
//
// New primitives (each reads the core rules; none conflicts with them):
//   * "(FROM ANY SOURCE)" DUEL DELAY (Honor Never Falls' Focus Effect). The R2 duel delay (EmperorRulingR2Cards.cs) records the effects the duel's OUTCOME applies to the delaying player's losing unit. This one is
//     mandatory (no "(now)" choice) and its DelayedLossChoice carries AnySource: besides the outcome, every effect a Focus Effect of ANOTHER player applies to that unit is recorded too (WithAnySourceLossDelays,
//     wrapped around each Focus Effect's application and around a Focus Effect's decision), all until the end of the turn (DelayUntil.EndOfTurn, applied at the top of EndTurn).
//   * A BASE-ABILITY-ONLY ADDITIONAL ACTION (Honor Never Falls' Battle half): AdditionalActionGrant.BaseAbilityOnly -- with the grant's PerformerId, spent only by one of the abilities PRINTED on that Personality
//     (his own definition's), never by one an attachment provides or one granted to him.
//   * A DELAYED DRAW (Kurohito's Perfection): DelayedKinds.Draw, an effect on a PLAYER recorded in the R2 store, applied when the End Phase begins (DelayUntil.EndPhaseBegins). The rulebook Favor Political
//     Limited action's twin ("favor-cycle-kurohito") is the same action paid with the discard of a card ignored, offered only to a player who controls the Celestial: the whole action's effects (a draw) are the
//     recorded effect. It shares the rulebook action's per-turn use and every rule that names it (Ring of Air's count of Favor actions, the Political classification, the Favor discard as a cost).
//   * A TRAIT ON ANY CARD'S DESTRUCTION (Makito): AfterCardDestroyed, called where a card is destroyed (a unit or its attachments, a lone attachment, a Region).
//   * A DESTRUCTION THAT WILL NOT BE NEGATED OR DELAYED (Makito's Maho Battle): the action counts as one whose destruction is never negated or delayed, the same question Yoritomo Hiromi's Battle actions and The Shadow's
//     Lair answer (HiromiPerforms -> HiromiUnnegatable): NegatesEffect, Delay (CannotBeDelayed), Wide Valley, Megumi's Guidance, Fields of Mercy, Negishi, Gift Armor and the whole-action protection all read it. The
//     effect choice that picks the card to destroy resolves as the action's own (ResolveEffectChoice sets the running command).

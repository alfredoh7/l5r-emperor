// Action-effect tracking (issue #437): what a resolved action did to specific cards, kept only long enough for a Reaction whose own trigger
// asks about it to check. Two pieces:
//   - Recording: DestroyUnits, DestroyAttachment, MoveHome and MoveByRule's own move-to-a-battlefield path append to MatchState.CurrentActionAffected
//     as they run (RecordActionEffect). Never for the mass casualty sweep a battle's own resolution performs directly (MatchEngine.cs's own
//     DestroyUnits(d)/DestroyUnits(a) calls, with no acting player) -- that is "the battle's own resolution," not "a Battle action," the same
//     distinction the printed cards below draw. DestroyUnits itself is only ever called with an acting player id from within an action's own
//     effects (an ability, a deferred Attack's hit, a duel's outcome), so gating recording on that parameter being present is exact, not a guess.
//   - Reading: FinishActionEffectTracking, called from the three points an action -- including its own reaction windows -- is truly done
//     (CompleteAbilityResolution, ResolveAttack, Dueling.cs's FinishDuelResolution), snapshots the accumulator into MatchState.LastResolvedAction
//     (replacing whatever was there before) and opens the after-action-resolved Reaction window below if anyone holds one that applies.
//
// What is NOT tracked: a bow. Unlike destroy/move, nothing bows a card through one shared choke point -- over a hundred call sites set
// CardInstance.Bowed directly today, none narrated individually. Reading every one of them (or building a shared Bow() helper and migrating all
// of them) is its own, much larger task; Hida Defenders (oracle-l5r-3083, "after your action bowed, destroyed, or moved an opposing Personality")
// stays blocked on that piece alone, now that the destroyed/moved half of its own condition is otherwise expressible.

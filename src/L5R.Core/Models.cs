// RemovedFromGame (issue #184 -- core rules Glossary): a card here can never be targeted or used
// again under any circumstance, distinct from Dead/DynastyDiscard/FateDiscard -- both Fate and
// Dynasty cards mix into this one zone, matching the single shared "Removed from Game" pile the
// client will render (a Dead/DynastyDiscard/FateDiscard card is always specifically one or the
// other; this one is neither, and both kinds of card can end up here).
// Focused (issue #204 -- Dueling): a Fate card played face-down next to a dueling Personality. Not
// "played" in the ordinary sense (no ability on it resolves except a "Focus Effect" one, later, in
// the duel's own resolution order) -- visible to its own owner immediately, to both players once the
// duel's own Struck reveal happens (PendingDuel.Struck), same shape as a private Hand card that
// becomes public.
// EventInPlay (Suspicions, the first Event): an Event's printed text normally resolves once, in the
// Events Phase, then goes straight to DynastyDiscard (core rules Glossary -- "resolves and is
// discarded"). An Event whose own text is an ongoing/"until the end of the game" effect instead sits
// here -- a physical reminder area next to a player's Personalities (the client's own future
// "sideboard" rendering, not yet built) -- rather than the discard pile, for as long as that effect
// stays active. Nothing yet moves a card OUT of this zone (Suspicions' own effect never ends), but the
// intended shape for a future card that does end it is: move to DynastyDiscard, same as an ordinary
// Event. Public zone, not hidden information, like RemovedFromGame.
// Region (the first being Low Market/Fallow Lands): attaches to a PROVINCE, not to another card --
// deliberately a distinct Zone from Attached (which always resolves its parent via
// CardInstance.AttachedTo/Card(...)) so Attachments()/DestroyAttachment()/AtBattle() never misfire on
// it. ProvinceState.RegionId is the province-side pointer (the province "owns" the Region, mirroring
// CardId for the Dynasty card sitting there); the Region's own AttachedTo stays null and its
// ProvinceIndex names which province it is attached to. Public, face-up, like a Holding/Personality
// once revealed. Visually renders like an ordinary attachment despite the different host.
// Celestial (the first being Lady Matsu's Rage): unlike Event/Region, enters play the instant it is
// revealed in ANY phase (not deferred to the controller's own next Events Phase) and never
// resolves-once-then-discards or attaches to anything -- it just stays in play, in the player's own
// right-side sideboard alongside Rings and reminders (a visual grouping only; Rings themselves still
// use Zone.Home internally), until something removes it. A player may control more than one Celestial
// only in passing -- entering play immediately discards every OTHER Celestial that same player
// controls, so at most one survives at rest.
// Underneath (issue #503, The New Foundries): a card set face-up under a Stronghold -- public, not in play (EmperorP5Zones.cs).

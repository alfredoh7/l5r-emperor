// ======================================================================================================================================================================================
// ISSUE #501, MECHANICS GROUP A: ADDITIONAL ACTIONS AND PHASES (Mendon's items 1-5, verbatim in the issue's specification). Cards: Isawa Momoko (personality), Mirumoto Inokuchi (personality),
// Beyond the Line, One Action, Two Strikes, String of Victories (strategies) and Aramasu's Legacy (stronghold). Every card was read letter by letter against its scan (the scan is authoritative).
//
// New primitives (each reads the core rules and Mendon's rulings; none conflicts with them):
//   * PASS AND DECLINE (item 2). An additional action granted with "may" is optional: DECLINING it (command "declineAdditionalAction", offered while the player holds an optional grant) is not passing --
//     his optional grants are gone and the priority goes to the other player as after his last action, the count of consecutive passes untouched. TAKING it AS A PASS is passing: the pass spends
//     ONE grant (PassSpendsAdditionalAction; a mandatory one first, then an unrestricted one) and he keeps the priority while he holds another. A phase (or a battle) ends only when BOTH players
//     have passed in succession (CountPass): one player passing twice in a row -- two additional actions taken as passes -- counts once. A grant whose text does not say "may" (Beyond the Line:
//     "Take an additional action") is Mandatory: it may be taken as a pass, never declined.
//   * GRANTS SCOPED BY WHAT SPENDS THEM (item 3). AdditionalActionGrant.RequiredActionKeyword (the action must carry that keyword, read as every "[keyword] action" classification is:
//     ActionCarriesKeyword) and Tag (a grant with a rule of its own). Both are RESTRICTED grants (EmperorStrongholdBatch1.RestrictedGrant): while a player holds only restricted grants he may take
//     only an action one of them allows, pass, or decline. Beyond the Line's grant (Tag BeyondTheLineTag) is spent only by a Limited or Open Recon ability used AS A BATTLE ACTION (MechAActsAsBattle:
//     the timing check, the listing and the Battle-action presence rules all read it) that targets the current battlefield's province, and then the player draws a card after that action's
//     resolution (AfterMechAActionResolved, from the two points an action is truly done: FinishActionEffectTracking and CompleteNegatedAction).
//   * THE PER-BATTLE RECORD OF BATTLE ACTIONS (item 4): MechAState.TookBattleActionBattle -- the battle (BattleNumber) in which each player last took a Battle action at an ordinary opportunity
//     (a non-Reaction ability, a Strategy, an Equip or a Reserve recruit in the Combat Segment). A PER-PLAYER, PER-BATTLE LOCK ON NEW GRANTS (GrantLockBattle, read by GrantAdditionalAction):
//     One Action, Two Strikes' "You will not take any other additional Battle actions this battle".
//   * GRANTS IN THE ACTION PHASE (item 5) already existed (issue #453); a Battle/Open action taken in a battle now spends a grant like a Battle-timed one (it used to end the burst).
//   * A GRANT FOLLOWED AFTER IT IS GONE: AdditionalActionGrant.Id plus MechAState.InokuchiWatches / SpentGrantIds -- after every command (Apply's tail, CheckInokuchiWatches) a watched grant that is
//     no longer held and was not spent by an action (declined, taken as a pass, lapsed with the battle, never created) triggers its consequence ("If you don't, bow him").
//   * A COST WAIVER FOR ONE ANNOUNCED ACTION (Isawa Momoko): MechAState.MomokoWatches ("the next time this turn you announce an action on one of Momoko's Spells") and WaivedAction; every
//     non-destruction cost of that action (a declared cost, a cost option, its Gold) is ignored (MomokoWaivesCost, read by AbilityCosts.cs, AlternativeCosts.cs and GoldQuotes.cs).
//   * A WHOLE ATTACK PHASE INSIDE THE ACTION PHASE (item 1, Aramasu's Legacy; the AsideBattle of the rulings pass R1 generalised from one battlefield to a phase): the Action Phase pauses (no phase
//     ends or begins: SetPhase is bypassed on the way in and out), the controller is the Attacker and declarer, a battlefield exists at each of the Defender's provinces, and Infantry Maneuvers,
//     Cavalry Maneuvers, the battle order, engagement, Battle actions and resolution run as normal. PER-PHASE EXEMPTIONS read by the resolution (AramasuResolutionActive): the defending army is
//     not destroyed (a tie destroys only the attacking one), no province is destroyed, and the resolution does not bow the controller's Mantis Clan Magistrates or his attachments. A PER-PHASE
//     WIN RECORD (AramasuPhaseState.WonAny: more Force at resolution, even against no units). When the phase ends (EmperorRemainingC.FinishAttackPhaseEnd, after the after-Attack-Phase window) the
//     Action Phase resumes and, if any battle was won, the controller may target a Personality or Holding: it is bowed and its straightening is negated until after his next Straighten Phase ends
//     (a StraightenHold). The action then completes with its ordinary tail.

// Issue #821: "will not attack or defend with" -- assignment rules over ONE SIDE of a battlefield (an army), built on the P11 card-restriction store (CardRestrictions.cs).
//
// P11's NoPair judges every card standing at the battlefield, on both sides, so it cannot say "they may stand opposed". These two kinds judge only the cards of the assigned card's OWN side:
//
//   SoleUnit     Hida Kaiji - exp: "Will not attack or defend with other Personalities, and other Personalities will not attack or defend with Kaiji." A card that carries it is never assigned into an
//                army that holds another Personality of its side, and no Personality of its side is assigned into an army that holds it. The opposing army is never considered (Mendon, 2026-10-10).
//   NoSameArmy   Isawa Ryuzo: "They will not attack or defend in the same army." A stored pair (AddSameArmyPair): the two Personalities are never assigned into one army. A card may be in several pairs
//                (Ryuzo is not Unique, so up to three pairs can stack on one Personality), and a pair does not touch the pairs the same cards have with others.
//
// THE PRIMITIVE is SideUnitsAt / SideUnitCount: the Personalities of a card's own side at a battlefield, those already standing there plus those the same command assigns there. Every consult point reads it.
//
// "Will not assign" removes the assignment, nothing else: a Personality may still be MOVED to the battlefield (an Engage or Battle action, a Reaction), because the rule is about being assigned.
// RequireArmyMayAssign judges the assignment command; ArmyAssignmentTemplate keeps the offered "assign everyone" command legal, so an offered command is never one the engine would refuse.

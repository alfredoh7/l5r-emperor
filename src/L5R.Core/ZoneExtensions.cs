//   CARDS UNDER A HOST     Zone.Underneath was one public pile under the owner's Stronghold (EmperorP5Zones.cs). A card may now sit under any card: CardInstance.HostCardId names the host, FaceUp says whether
//                          it is public. PutUnder / UnderCards are the helpers. A FACE-DOWN under-card is private: the other seat's view carries a redacted card (no definition, id "hidden-under-<host>-<n>"), the
//                          other seat's slot candidates never list it, and no event names it. Cards under a host that leaves play are discarded (the engine's one sweep, below). Equip from under: an
//                          AttachSpec with Pile = AttachPile.UnderHost attaches a card that sits under the ability's own source, paying the usual Equip price.
//   FROM A PROVINCE        AbilityDefinition.FromProvince: the ability is taken by its own card while that card is face up in its owner's province (AbilitySourceZoneAllows and the source list of AbilityActions
//                          honour it). RecruitFromProvince is the entry sequence such an action runs (Masaya, Kitsu Miwa, Yoritomo Mikaru): the card leaves its province, enters play (optionally bowed), the province is
//                          refilled and the entering windows open. The price is the ability's own Gold rule (GoldCostRule.TargetRecruit), never a term of this helper.
//   REFILL HOOK            EngineHooks.RefillFaceUp: Func<RefillContext, bool?> consulted by Refill; true makes that one refill face up. Oracle of the Void's "the next two refills this turn may be face up" is a
//                          card-owned count plus this hook; nothing else about refilling changes.
//   HISTORY                CardInstance.EnteredPlayTurn (stamped by the one sweep after every accepted command, from the turn the command began in; cleared when the card is not in play) and
//                          PlayerState.InPlayDuringLastTurn (the owner's Personalities in play when that owner's turn ended). HoldsNoDynasty(province) reads ProvinceState.HoldsNoDynastyCardsWhile (Kokure's Lands).
//   TO-DECK DELAY          DelayedKinds.ToDeck (Arg "Top" / "Bottom"): put in the delay store, applied by ToOwnerDeck; Masaya's "before the turn ends, put him on top of your Dynasty deck" is its first user.

// ISSUE #503, GROUP P1: the unwired Embers of War / Seeds of Decay cards the blocker review called "wirable now" (WIRE) or "one narrow extension" (SMALL). Every card was read letter by letter against
// its scan (the scan is authoritative; here it matches the catalogue's Oracle text for all of them).
//
// Wired: Asako Megu, Bayushi Nomen - exp2, Hida Bakishi, Hida Osote, Ikoma Hakige, Isawa Koiso, Itoku - exp, Akodo Tamisu, Isawa Sanetomo, Moto Taigo, Tsuruchi Shichiro (personality-wave-96),
// Damning Ceremony, Extending Influence, Mara's Touch, Ochiai's Bravery (spell-wave-26), Seeking the Question (strategy-wave-82), Hotei's Contentment (celestial-wave-10).
//
// New primitives (each checked against docs/rules/EMPEROR_EDITION_CORE_RULES.md; none conflicts with it):
//   * COST-ONLY SLOTS (TargetSlot.CostOnly): a card an action names only to pay a cost with ("destroy your Shugenja with the base Fire keyword, discard a card", Isawa Koiso) is chosen in a slot of its
//     own but is not a TARGET: it is not the command's primary target, opens no targeted-by-action window and is not among the action's targets for a targeting trait.
//   * A FORCE PENALTY AS A COST (CostVerbs.ForcePenalty, "Give this Shugenja -2F:", Mara's Touch): payable only when the wielder has that much Force to lose (core rules, Pay Costs), Cursed Relic's Chi
//     penalty twin.
//   * THE PER-TACTICIAN CAP (core rules Glossary, Tactical / Tactician): "each individual Tactician may perform at most one Tactical action per turn" -- enforced for every performing Personality (counted
//     where the action's effects resolve, so a wholly negated action does not count: Mendon's counter ruling); Moto Taigo's printed trait raises his own cap to three.
//   * A TARGETING TRAIT THAT OWES A DISCARD (Hida Osote): judged as an action is taken (its targets known); the discard is queued on the action and owed when it ends (resolved, or wholly negated),
//     answered through the ordinary forced-discard decision.
//   * A ONE-SHOT "NEXT TIME ANOTHER PLAYER'S ACTION TARGETS HIM" SHIELD (Hida Bakishi): a watch for the turn, spent by the next such announcement, which then negates every effect of that one action
//     on him (NegatesEffect, the Champion of Thunder "all" scope) for as long as that action resolves (its Attack or duel included).
//   * AFTER-ACTION TRAITS WITH A CHOICE (Akodo Tamisu's mandatory "give a Lion Clan Personality +1F", Tsuruchi Shichiro's optional once-per-battle move home, Ochiai's Bravery's "destroy a card without
//     attachments in the unit of the duel's loser"): queued where the action is truly done and answered one at a time through the general Either/Or decision (one option per candidate; a single legal
//     option resolves by itself) BEFORE any Reaction to the same moment (traits first, core rules). A Terrain played from hand (PlayStrategy) queues Tamisu's trait too and it is asked before priority
//     passes on.
//   * THE EQUIP BATTLE EXEMPTION (Isawa Sanetomo): once per battle one of his controller's Phoenix Clan Shugenja at the battlefield may perform the rulebook Equip (Battle) action while bowed or unopposed
//     (a Spell only: the rulebook Equip Battle attaches Spells); the exemption is spent only when it was needed.
//   * "MAY NOT ASSIGN TO, AND WILL NOT MOVE INTO, AN ATTACKING ARMY" for one Personality until the end of the turn (Hotei's Contentment; Goju Asuka's defending-army bar's mirror).

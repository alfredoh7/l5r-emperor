// ISSUE #503, PASS GROUP P5 (third file): hidden information, borrowed cards and copies. Every card was read against its scan.
//
//   * FACE-DOWN PROVINCE CARDS AS TARGETS WITHOUT LEAKING THEM (Petty Squabbles): a face-down province card is named by the id every view already gives it, "hidden-p{owner}-province{n}"
//     (MatchQueries.ViewCard), never by its instance id; one offered action per set of one or two such cards (either player's). Turned face-up, a Celestial enters play as it does whenever it
//     is revealed (core rules, Celestial); any other card stays face-up in its province.
//   * A PRIVATE LOOK AT CARDS IN ANOTHER PLAYER'S HAND (Scouting the Pass; The Price of Honor's shown hand): EmperorP5State.HandSights, read into MatchView.HandSights -- PRIVATE to the
//     looker, for the rest of the turn while the card stays in that hand, named by definition only (never an instance id). "Choose and look at two cards" in a hand the chooser cannot see is
//     a blind choice: the engine takes two at random (the persisted generator), which is what a blind choice is.
//   * "PUT HIM INTO PLAY" FROM A LOOK AT THE TOP OF A DECK (Searching for Answers): a "play" disposition of the look (DeckLook.cs), legal for a Personality of the viewer's own deck that he could
//     bring into play (his Honor Requirement, Unique/Singular, Loyal), entering at the current battlefield ignoring his Gold Cost; his entering-play windows open once the look is arranged; he is
//     discarded (with his unit) after the battle ends.
//   * A HOLDING THAT COPIES ANOTHER'S BASE ABILITY OR ITS GOLD-PRODUCING TRAIT (Stolen Merchandise): the ability through the copy primitive's GrantAbility (until the end of the turn); the
//     trait by giving the Holding, for the turn, the target's printed Gold production and the Effect that carries its Gold condition (CardInstance.Printed, read everywhere Definition is).
//   * PLAYING ANOTHER PLAYER'S STRATEGY (Learning): it is controlled by the player while the additional action that names it stands (EmperorP5State.Borrowed -- exempt from the return of
//     out-of-play cards to their owners), played from the discard pile with the additional action (Daigotsu Bofana's grant), and removed from the game after it resolves (it returns to its
//     owner's removed pile); "its abilities may be used an additional time this turn" is The Fires of War's second-use mark on the card.

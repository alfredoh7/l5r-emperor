// "He must pass at his next opportunity this phase to take a Battle, Limited, or Open action" (issue #338, Unfortunate Hesitation): a
// per-player restriction with a lifetime of one printed phase. It is a plain record of WHO owes the pass and in WHICH phase
// (PrintedPhases.Instance -- the whole Attack Phase is one phase, as for every "each phase" effect), so it lapses by comparison when the
// phase moves on and needs no clearing, and it is exactly what a replay reproduces.
//
// While it stands, at an ordinary opportunity of that player in the Action or Battle phase (they hold priority, nothing is pending) the only
// legal thing to do is pass: no Battle, Limited or Open action -- a useAbility, a played Strategy, a Reserve recruit or an equip -- is
// legal, and QueryActions lists them disabled with the reason. The pass IS the payment of the debt: it is spent by that player's next pass
// at such an opportunity. Reactions, purchasing in the Dynasty Phase, the Attack Phase's own assignment decisions and every pending decision
// are not "a Battle, Limited, or Open action" and are untouched.

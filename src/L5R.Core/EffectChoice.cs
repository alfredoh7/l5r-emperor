// Conditional effect choice (issue #337): an action whose effect branches on a condition evaluated when it RESOLVES, and that offers the
// acting player an engine-listed choice only on the "may" branch. Mirumoto Yumaru is the first card:
//
//   "Target an enemy Personality: If Yumaru has a Weapon, you may move her home and you may move the Personality home. Otherwise, move
//    both of them home."
//
// Mendon's ruling (verbatim in the decision doc): with a Weapon the player chooses one of THREE effects -- send Yumaru home, send the
// enemy Personality home, send both; without one the player "is not presented with any choices" and both are sent home.
//
// The shape is data on the ability (AbilityDefinition.Branch): a Condition, the Options offered when it holds (each a named list of
// effects), and the Otherwise option that simply happens when it does not. The flow when the action resolves:
//
//   1. The condition is read NOW -- after every "before this action resolves" reaction has had its say (a Weapon a reaction removed no
//      longer earns the choice; one it added does), not when the action was announced.
//   2. It fails: the Otherwise effects apply and the action carries on to its ordinary end. No decision exists, so none is asked.
//   3. It holds: a public "effectChoice" decision opens for the acting player, listing each option (QueryActions offers one
//      "chooseEffect" action per option, so a client that lists offered actions already shows it). The action waits.
//   4. The chosen option's effects apply, the negations a reaction set for this action are honoured exactly as they would have been
//      inline, and the action then completes through the same tail every action ends with (CompleteAbilityResolution).
//
// Nothing about the choice is hidden: the options, the chosen option and its effects are public, as for any resolved action.

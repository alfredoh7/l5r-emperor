// Maga-yari, Modifications, Reserve Weapon, Sasumata, Tsuruchi Daikyu) and follower-wave-31 (Bandit Gang, Ikiryo, the six House Guards, Legion of Pain). Every card reuses an existing
// primitive where one exists; what is new is small and documented at its use:
//   * a Reaction to another player targeting the WIELDER with an action, whose "choose a player who gains or loses 2 Honor" is two actions sharing one use (Armor of the Heavens);
//   * an attachment that returns from the discard pile to a Personality of its owner's after an action destroyed it or its Personality (Blade of Perfection: AttachSpec on a card in the Fate
//     discard pile, CardInstance.LastHostId remembering the Personality it was destroyed on), and one that attaches from the hand after engaging (Kensai's Blade);
//   * an "after this Personality is assigned" Reaction window (Chrysanthemum Blossom), opened once the assignment command has finished and read through the after-action-resolved machinery;
//   * a static Force bonus for the controller's Clan Personalities at the wielder's battlefield (Clan Standard);
//   * Chi penalties negated whatever their source and the item's own destruction negated except with its Personality (Gift Armor);
//   * an Equip discount by wielder keyword and "will not be transferred" (Maga-yari);
//   * a focus-replacing duel stat bonus (Reserve Weapon: PendingDuel.StatBonuses, the Focus command's "reserve" choice);
//   * a pay-or-destroy trait after a battle's resolution, an Either/Or decided by the Follower's controller (Bandit Gang);
//   * an Attack whose strength is read off the Chi of the Personality a destroyed Follower was last attached to (Ikiryo), off the host's Personal Honor (Ikoma House Guard), and one compared
//     against the lower of Force and Gold Cost (Tsuruchi House Guard);
//   * a target category comparing the units' total Force (Kaiu House Guard), a target category without a Weapon or Armor (Sasumata) and a static bar on being targeted by cheap Personalities'
//     actions (Legion of Pain).

// MASAYA (oracle-l5r-4853): "Open: If Masaya is face-up in one of your provinces: Bring him into play, paying all costs and paying 2 less Gold. Before the turn ends, put him on top of your
// Dynasty deck."
//
// Mendon: "Masaya has a Reserve-like ability that allows the player to recruit him during the Action Phase as an Open action." It is Rise of the Dark Naga's province recruit (the target is the
// face-up province card; the shared recruit entry sequence: his entry price, the entry windows, a Proclaim eligible quote, the province refilled) taken by the card itself:
//   * The action's own Gold cost is the ordinary recruit price less 2, never below 0 (GoldCostRule.TargetRecruit(-2, 0)); the other costs of entering play (an Honor Requirement, Unique, an additional
//     entry cost) are the ones QuotePurchase applies to every recruit. It is an Open action: the Action Phase only (R-030) -- not the Battle Phase, where the Reserve recruit is taken.
//   * "Before the turn ends, put him on top of your Dynasty deck" is a debt paid at the top of EndTurn (SearchPlayReturns, beside the other turn-end checks): he is put on top of
//     his owner's Dynasty deck, face down, and his unit leaves play with him (his attachments go on top of their owners' Fate decks, as Ninube Shiho's does). Like the shared delay store's effects it is
//     re-validated when its turn comes: a Masaya who has left play meanwhile (destroyed, discarded, sent to a deck) has nothing to put on top, and the effect is negated (most conservative reading).

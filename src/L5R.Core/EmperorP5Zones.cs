// ISSUE #503, PASS GROUP P5 (second file): zones and records. Every card was read against its scan.
//
//   * A ZONE UNDER A CARD (The New Foundries): Zone.Underneath -- a card set face-up under its controller's Stronghold. It is not in play (none of its abilities can be used), public (both players
//     see it: PlayerView.Underneath, client lane) and leaves only as the card that holds it says (discarded: to its owner's Fate discard pile). A Stronghold holds the cards under it for as long as
//     the game lasts.
//   * A CARD'S ABILITIES PERMANENTLY REMOVED (Unsettling Doubts): EmperorP5State.AbilitiesRemoved -- while that card stays in play it has none of its abilities (AbilityIdsOf's hook); the record is
//     dropped the moment it leaves play (swept after every command), so the card is a new object if it ever enters play again. Traits are not abilities (core rules, Reading the Cards).
//   * A UNIT REMOVED FROM THE GAME AND PUT BACK (Step Through the Void): the Shugenja and every card attached to him leave play together, the attachments staying attached (their AttachedTo is
//     kept while all of them are removed from the game); at the top of EndTurn ("before this turn ends", the delay store's point) the unit re-enters play at home, whole, with no cost paid, no
//     entering-play effect or window and no restriction checked.
//   * A UNIT TO THE BOTTOM OF ITS OWNERS' DECKS IN A CHOSEN ORDER (Riddle of Rebirth): each card to its owner's appropriate deck (ToOwnerDeck); a created card is removed from the game instead; the
//     acting player names the order (a DeciderChoice of his, one card at a time).
//   * A ONE-SHOT SHIELD (Blessings of the Shi-Tien Yen-Wang): "Negate the next card effect that bows, destroys, or moves him" -- until the end of the turn (Mendon's durations ruling), spent by the
//     first card effect that would bow, destroy or move him (StalwartNegatesBow, DestructionShielded and EnemyActionMovementAutoNegated's hooks). A cost is not an effect.
//   * A STRAIGHTEN-PHASE-START OPTIONAL TRAIT (Blessings: "After your turn begins: You may choose your dead Personality and put him at the top of your deck"): asked as the Straighten Phase begins,
//     before Bayushi Rentatsu's loss (the active player orders simultaneous start-of-turn traits; this one is his own).
//   * THE OPPONENT'S HAND SHOWN TO THE ACTING PLAYER (The Price of Honor): the target's controller decides (EitherOr); if he shows it, the acting player may discard a card from it (a DeciderChoice of
//     his, whose options name the shown cards -- only his own QueryActions carry them); if not, the Personality is not affected by the rulebook seppuku action until the turn ends.

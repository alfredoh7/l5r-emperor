// PROMOTIONAL-EMPEROR PASS (issue #653), bringing cards into play from a pile: Resurrection, Renewal, Govern the Land, Re-fortification, Peace, and Imperial Charter's created Holdings.
//
//   * RESURRECTION / RENEWAL: Tokiko's shape (a dead or discarded Personality brought into play for his whole recruit price, at home), with "Discard a card" as a declared cost on a hand slot.
//     Renewal's "it is not the active player's first or second turn" is judged against the player whose turn it is (his TurnsTaken counts his turns), whoever plays the Open action; its
//     "discarded Personality" is any Personality in his discard pile, a dead one included (Mendon, issue #420: a dead Personality is a discarded one too).
//   * GOVERN THE LAND / RE-FORTIFICATION: a Holding in the player's own discard pile is brought into play bowed (a Holding enters play bowed; the printed "(bowed)" is a reminder) for its whole
//     recruit price (QuotePurchase, which now prices a Holding from a discard pile as it prices a Personality), through the entering-play window every recruit opens. Govern's second action is
//     Foothills Keep's attach from a discard pile; Re-fortification's Battle half is Absent ("even if you control no units at the current battlefield") and bows the Castle as its cost.
//   * PEACE: a Dynasty deck search for a non-Unique Holding recruited bowed (Versatile Farm's search recruit, which enters its Holding unbowed; SearchEntersBowed says which).
//   * IMPERIAL CHARTER: "Starting with you, each player may create an unbowed Holding with the trait 'Bow this card: Produce 2 Gold.'" -- two optional decisions (the acting player's, then the
//     other player's) through the decider choice (DeciderChoice.cs hooks), each creating the published Charter Holding (oracle-l5r-10806) under his own control.

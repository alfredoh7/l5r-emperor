//   4.2 Engage actions / "after engaging"      OpenEngageWindow ... PassReaction -> CloseEngageWindow (this file)
//   4.3 the Attacker may play the first action ResolveFirstOpportunity: an attacker-side claim (a Reaction, or Naval
//       Invasion) that no defender-side claim overrode
//   4.4 otherwise the Defender does            the default SelectBattle seeds (priority to 1 - ActivePlayerId)

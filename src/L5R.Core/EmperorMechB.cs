// ======================================================================================================================================================================================
// ISSUE #501, MECHANICS GROUP B: CONTROL TRANSFER (Mendon's items 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10; item 32's engine side is EmperorMechBCopies.cs).
//
// Mendon's rulings (verbatim in the brief, summarised):
//   6.  Giving control (Goju Asuka) works the same way as taking control; giving originates from the controller, taking from the other player. Asuka, after being recruited, is transferred to the
//       receiving player's home: optional for her controller, not for the receiver.
//   7.  Gaining control of a Personality: in the Action Phase the entire unit goes to the taker's home in whatever state it is; during battle the unit leaves its controller's side of the battlefield for
//       the other side there. The taker uses him and his attachments as though he had recruited them, until an effect returns him. It is not a recruit, not an entering play, and triggers no Proclaim.
//   8.  Control given to a card's OWNER: the Personality moves from its controller's home / battlefield side to its owner's home / side, in its current state (dishonored stays dishonored, new
//       attachments are kept). Yoritomo Sachina's return triggers the next time she leaves play, whenever that is, immediately, and cannot be negated.
//   9.  Black Marketeering is a time-bound take (item 7), and may be paid in part by Luxurious Silk (it is not a recruit).
//   10. Only a Shadow grants Goju Asuka's non-straightening trait (against non-Ninja) and gives control of the Personality who gains it to the opponent.
//
// The engine reads CardInstance.OwnerId as the CONTROLLER of an in-play card everywhere ("you control", sides, homes, armies, Gold sources, Unique/Singular), and CardInstance.OriginalOwnerId as the
// real OWNER while another player controls it; every card returns to its OWNER's piles the moment it leaves play (AttachAction.cs, ReturnCardsOutOfPlayToTheirOwners; ReturnToHand / ToOwnerDeck restore
// the owner first). So a control change is: OwnerId := new controller for the Personality and every card attached to him. Where he is follows from that: a card at home is in its controller's home,
// a card at a battlefield is on its controller's side. Nothing enters play, so no entry trait, Reaction or Proclaim fires, and nothing about the card is reset.
//
// New primitives:
//   * TransferUnitControl: the one whole-unit control change (take, give, return). Loyal and Unique/Singular refuse a take or give (the 2026-09-12 control-transfer decision); an attachment of the unit
//     the new controller already has a Unique/Singular copy of is DISCARDED (core rules, Singular/Unique). "controlNegated": an action's control change is negated by a negation of all its effects on the
//     Personality (NegatesEffect kind "control"); a return to the owner never is.
//   * CONTROL RETURNS (MatchState.MechB.ControlReturns): "give control of him to his owner" owed later, on one of three triggers -- the turn ending (Black Marketeering), a card leaving play (Sachina)
//     or an ability being announced again (Shadow Dragon). A return is never negated. A return blocked by Unique/Singular (the owner now controls another copy) waits, and is retried after every
//     command, until that copy leaves play or his control (the 2026-09-12 decision).
//   * THE INFILTRATOR STRAIGHTEN TRAIT ("After a Straighten Phase begins: Choose your bowed non-X Personality. Negate his straightening this phase."): printed on Goju Asuka (non-Spider Clan) and granted
//     permanently by Only a Shadow (non-Ninja, MatchState.MechB.InfiltratorGrants). At the start of its controller's Straighten Phase the controller chooses (a "infiltratorStraighten" pending choice
//     answered by "chooseInfiltratorStraighten" with a TargetId when there is more than one candidate) and the chosen Personality gets a StraightenPhaseEnds hold (StraightenHolds.cs).
//   * ASUKA'S DEFENDING-ARMY BAR: "may not assign, and will not move, into a defending army" -- Assign (defence), the created-battlefield assignment and MoveToBattlefield refuse it; the defence offer
//     leaves her out.

// The declarative ability data lives here (added to AbilityCatalog.All by one hook); the shared engine files carry short, commented hooks into this file, each naming its card.
//
// New primitives:
//   * A DECK-CONSTRUCTION RULE PRINTED ON A STRONGHOLD (Eternal Victory Dojo): DeckWorkshop.StrategyCopyRuleOf / BattleStrategyOf, read by DeckWorkshop.Review.
//   * A GOLD SOURCE THAT IS A REACTION TO A KIND OF PAYMENT, EVEN IF ITS CARD IS BOWED (Library of Rebirth): AbilityDefinition.PaymentWhen / PaymentEvenIfBowed, beside Sakuma's
//     alternate source (GoldQuotes.cs) but for a card that also has a printed production.
//   * A DELAYED DRAW AT THE NEXT END PHASE, WHOSE EVER IT IS (Eternal Victory Dojo): MatchState.PendingEndPhaseDraws, drawn as the End Phase begins.
//   * A RESTRICTED ADDITIONAL ACTION (Koshin Keep): AdditionalActionGrant.RangedTargetId -- "an additional Ranged Attack Battle action that may only target the same card".
//   * FAVOR TOKENS AND A FAVOR-DISCARD SUBSTITUTION (Kyuden Otomo - exp): every action that discards the Imperial Favor as a cost may instead discard a Favor token from the
//     Stronghold (a cost option of the command); every way of taking the Favor is recorded on the action (TakeImperialFavor) for "after you take the Imperial Favor".
//   * A PROVINCE-SET TARGET AND AN ADDITIONAL INFANTRY MANEUVERS SEGMENT (Hidden Falls Dojo): GameCommand.Provinces, MatchState.HiddenFallsGrants / ExtraInfantrySegment.
//   * A WATCH THAT FIRES ON EITHER SIDE'S ASSIGNMENT OR THE END OF AN ACTION THE TARGET PERFORMED (Midday Shadow Court): a new AssignmentWatch kind.

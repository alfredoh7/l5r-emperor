// Without Mercy (Torn Asunder, oracle-l5r-10405, issue #648): "Reaction: After a Battle action performed by your Samurai Personality resolves, if the action did not target an enemy card:
// Take an additional Battle action."
//
// It rides the after-action-resolved Reaction window (ActionEffectTracking.cs), which already offers a Strategy in hand to its owner after any action. What the window did not know is
// what the action TARGETED, so ResolvedActionFacts.TargetIds records it (the command's named targets, a duel's challenged Personality, an Attack's target card; an Attack at a province
// names no card). "An enemy card" is a card another player owns. The window and its eligibility are decided here; the additional Battle action is the ordinary grant every other card makes.
//
// Reading, for confirmation: an action that targets nothing (a Battle Open ability with no target, a province Attack, a Strategy that affects "all") did not target an enemy card, so the
// Reaction applies; an action whose only targets are the performer's own cards applies too.

// end of the turn, and it depends on the Kensai's Weapon live -- the bar is checked every time an action is announced, so a Weapon lost mid-turn ends it and one gained brings it back.
// "An action the Personality performs" is the card that performs it in the engine's own sense (the same rule as PerformingCardForce): the performer the ability names, else the card it is on,
// and an Item or Spell's action is performed by the Personality it is attached to. Every card the action targets is judged (its target, an attack's card, each slot's cards); the check is
// made where an action is validated, so an action that the bar forbids is neither offered nor accepted, and costs nothing.

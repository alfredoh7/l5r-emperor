// Generalized Gold payment (issue #303). ONE place decides what an action costs in Gold.
//
// Before this file, an ability's cost was written down four times by hand (ValidateAbility's cost chain,
// AbilityActions' parallel per-candidate chain, each ability's own Pay(...) call in the execution switch,
// and the client re-deriving it for its panel) and they had drifted apart: an option could be offered with
// sources that ValidateAbility then rejected (Kharmic, the Invest cards), Noritada's Invest and a non-
// Strategy Discipline validated a payment and then never charged it, and only recruit/equip/Strategy ever
// got a payment panel. Now every ability carries a GoldCostRule (AbilityDefinition.Cost), this file
// interprets it into one AbilityCost, and validation, option generation, the GoldQuote shipped to the
// client and the payment itself all read that same AbilityCost. Purchase, recruitReserve, equip and
// playStrategy reuse the same GoldQuote shape so the client has exactly one payment panel.

// Emperor Edition remaining-cards pass (issue #492), group E: the Spells of spell-wave-23 (Capturing the Soul, Cleansing the Path, Consecration, Contemplate the Void, Hanabi, I Give You My Name,
// Obscured Pathways, The Kami's Blessing, Thunder's Favor, Unnatural Flood, Warded Paths) and the Kami Celestials of celestial-wave-8 (the nine "Guidance" cards). Chikushudo's Trickery and Summon Swamp
// Spirits stay unwired: see tools/content/ee_remE_blockers.json.
//
// The declarative ability data is here (added to AbilityCatalog.All by one hook); the shared engine files carry short, commented hooks into this file, each naming its card.
//
// New primitives (each reads the core rules; none conflicts with them):
//   * COSTS: "discard your hand (even if empty)" (CostVerbs.DiscardHand), "bow every card chosen for a slot" (CostVerbs.BowSlotCards -- the other performing Shugenja of Capturing the Soul) and a bow owed only
//     "if he is home" (ActionCost.IfSubjectHome -- Obscured Pathways).
//   * SEARCH: places searched in order ("your discard pile, then Fate deck", SearchSpec.Ordered), the Dynasty discard pile as a searchable place (SearchDeck.DynastyDiscard), a Personality put into play by a
//     search ignoring its cost (SearchEffect.PutIntoPlay, with the entering-play window opened as the search ends), a card put into a chosen province face-up (SearchEffect.ToProvinceFaceUp), a Gold Cost ceiling read
//     from the action (PendingSearch.GoldLimit) and an Honor loss owed however the search ends (PendingSearch.HonorLossOnFinish).
//   * WATCHES: Consecration's "after the first time this turn a Personality assigns or moves to an attacking army at one of those provinces' battlefields" (MatchState.ConsecrationWatches).
//   * CELESTIAL TRAITS, all read live off the Celestials in play (either player's, as printed): Akodo's Guidance (Lion Clan players may target defending enemy units with the rulebook Favor Battle action),
//     Bayushi's Guidance (a Scorpion Clan player's turn begins: the others lose 1 Honor), Daigotsu's Guidance (a Celestial enters play: every Kami Celestial is discarded), Doji's Guidance (Crane Clan players take
//     the Favor Battle action with no unit at the battlefield), Hida's Guidance (the first straightening of a Personality each battle is negated when his enemy leader is a Crab Clan player), Shiba's Guidance
//     (a battle resolution in which a Phoenix Clan player destroyed provinces or cards: he draws), Shinjo's Guidance (+1F to Unicorn Clan Personalities with an attachment), Togashi's Guidance (+2 maximum hand
//     size for Dragon Clan players) and Yoritomo's Guidance (after engaging, a Mantis Clan Attacker's battlefield province is reduced to strength 5).
//   * WARDED PATHS: +3F while its Shugenja defends; a Defender with an Earth Shugenja carrying it chooses the order in which the battles are fought (the battle-selection priority).
//   * A Ring put into play by another card's text does not count for Enlightenment (core rules: each Ring must have most recently entered play via its own printed text) -- Togashi's Guidance.

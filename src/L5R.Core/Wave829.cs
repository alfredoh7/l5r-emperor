//
//   Well-Tended Farm         ":bow:: Produce 1 Gold. / Limited, :bow:: Gain 1 Honor."                                   a Holding's printed production and one Limited bow ability
//   One Koku                 "Reaction: When paying a Gold cost: Produce one Gold."                                    a payment token for a Strategy IN HAND, discarded when chosen (Near Miss's shape)
//   Shrine to the Heavens    ":bow:: Produce 2 Gold. / After one of your Celestials is revealed in a Province, you may choose one of your Celestials in play. If you do, it is not discarded..."
//                            a trait: each Shrine in play adds one P6 Celestial entry decision (CelestialEntryRegistry), checked only when a Celestial is revealed
//   Cross-Clan Wedding       a province-reveal Event (P5): the owner gives a Personality; if the other player now controls it, THAT player gives one of his other Personalities back
//   The Onyx Championship    a province-reveal Event (P5): a Shugenja permanently gains Shadowlands and the Maho Limited that destroys another Personality to recruit an Oni from the discard pile (dead Oni too)
//   Minor Blackmail          a province-reveal Event (P5): a standing watch (not timed) for the chosen Personality performing an action or being assigned to a battlefield
//   Caught Unawares          "Open: If you control no Personalities, target one or two Personalities: Bow them. Negate their straightening (this turn). If it is not your turn, draw a card. /
//                            Battle: Target an enemy card with no unbowed attachments: Bow it."
//   The Duty of the Crab     a Focus Effect that may delay the loss of a duel, and a Battle recruit at the current battlefield from a province or the discard pile
//   Stone of Remembrance     a Holding that counts as zero cards toward the minimum deck size, and a Reaction that removes it to negate a destruction
//   Benten's Blessing        a Celestial: up to two face-up Personalities in or out of play gain +1PH while it remains in play (a multi-pick decision), and a redirecting Reaction
//   Jizo's Mercy             a Celestial: a Battle move home, and a Battle that replaces the destruction of the Province in this battle's resolution with 4 Honor

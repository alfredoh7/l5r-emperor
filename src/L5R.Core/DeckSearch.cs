namespace L5R.Core;

// Deck search (issue #312): ONE reusable "search a deck, select a legal card, show it, apply the effect,
// shuffle" flow, private to the searching player. First consumers: Ikoma Shizuka (a choice of two decks,
// each with its own criteria and its own effect) and Imperial Gift (one deck, one criteria). The catalogue
// has ~44 more cards that search a deck or a discard pile; the pieces below are shaped for that family:
//
//   1. SearchSpec/SearchCriteria are DECLARATIVE data on the ability (AbilityDefinition.Search) or, for an
//      Event, looked up from its Effect (SearchCatalog.ForEventEffect). The engine evaluates the criteria per
//      candidate; the client never filters or decides legality.
//   2. The flow is one pending state (MatchState.PendingSearch) driven by four PendingChoice types, in
//      exactly this order:  optional deck choice -> candidate list -> select (or pass when nothing
//      qualifies) -> SHOW the card to the opponent -> APPLY the card's own effect -> SHUFFLE the searched
//      deck (also when the player passed) -> the action resolves and play continues.
//   3. Hidden information: the searcher's MatchView.PendingSearch lists the deck's remaining cards GROUPED
//      by card with a count, sorted by type then name (never deck order), each with an eligibility flag and
//      a short reason. The opponent gets none of it -- only public events that a search happened and, after
//      selection, the deliberately shown card (MatchView.ShownCards). The RNG state and the deck order never
//      leave the engine.
//
// The shown-cards record is keyed by a per-match sequence number, NOT the card's instance id (see
// docs/decisions/2026-09-18-deck-search-primitive.md): an instance id would be a handle the opponent could
// try to resolve elsewhere, and the record needs only the definition to be reviewable.

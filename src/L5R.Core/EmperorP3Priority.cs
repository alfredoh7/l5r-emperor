// ======================================================================================================================================================================================
// ISSUE #503, GROUP P3 (continued): priority overrides, announcement windows, Henshin entries and a Kata's Honor-gain Reaction.
//   * A REACTION LOCKOUT FOR ONE ACTION (Thunder Dragon - exp2, Shosuro Aroru - exp2): "Other players may not take Reactions until it ends" -- P3.ReactionLockouts names the locked player and
//     the action; while it has not ended, that player's Reactions are refused (ValidateAbility) and are not counted as held by the windows' availability checks, the way Cherry Blossom
//     Festival's bar is. Thunder Dragon's is a trait triggered as he performs an action (its announcement); Aroru's is an effect of his Battle action (it applies as the action resolves).
//     The lock ends where the action's tail begins (P3AfterHeldAction: its resolution, its negated taking, a deferred Attack's end, a duel's end, a search or look's end), so the Reactions
//     "after it resolves" are not locked.
//   * STATIC GRANTS OF THE THUNDER DRAGON: +1F and "Battle: Target an enemy card without unbowed attachments: Bow it." for its controller's Mantis Clan Personalities (itself included).
//   * A HOST THAT REFUSES A CLASS OF ATTACHMENTS (Aroru: "Will not attach non-Ninja Followers"), read by HostRefusesAttachment.
//   * A REDIRECT WITH A DEFERRED TAIL (Aroru): "Choose another of your cards. The action targets it instead, if legal. After the action's resolution, you may move Aroru to a different
//     location." -- the move is owed when the held action has finished and asked (a "p3AroruMove" choice, answered by "p3AroruMove" with Choice "home", a Province, or neither to decline) once
//     the command leaves nothing open.
//   * MORE ANNOUNCE WATCHERS (Ikoma Ayumu, Utaku Lishan): "after you announce a Tactical / Battle action". The announce window (Tsuruchi Yakusho's) asks one watcher at a time; each P3 watcher
//     not yet asked for the announcement is asked in turn (P3.Priority.Announcements). Battle actions that are not abilities (a Terrain played, a Reserve recruit, a Battle equip) and additional Battle
//     actions get the same window: the command is judged legal by running it on a copy of the state first, then set aside while the window is open and run when it closes.
//   * HENSHIN ENTRIES (Asako Kikugoro): his own entry (own-enters-play), another of his player's Henshin entering play or overlaying (the entry window every overlay also opens), and one of
//     his player's Rings entering play (the after-action record Yung reads) -- three catalog entries sharing the printed action's one use.
//   * AN HONOR GAIN NOT FROM AN ACTION (Destructive Priorities): "Before you gain Honor during your turn" -- the R4 window before an Honor change (EmperorRulingR4Honor.cs) also opens on a
//     gain that no action caused (a battle's resolution, a trait) for a player whose Kata grants this Reaction; only that Reaction is offered there. "Negate the gain" marks that change
//     (its action key and occurrence), read by GainHonor as the command is run again.

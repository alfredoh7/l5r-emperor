// cannot open. Each test opens the real window through ordinary engine play (a purchase, an equip, a Recruit in battle, a Battle action, an engage ...), proves the ability is offered
// enabled to its own player only, refused for the other player, accepted with the printed effect asserted by number/zone, and that once the window is closed (or was never opened) the very

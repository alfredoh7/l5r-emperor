// battlefield -- an enemy card sent somewhere other than home, and the source going with it, are both new. The destination is data on the ability
// (home / current battlefield / adjacent unresolved / another unresolved), the engine lists the legal battlefields in ActionOption.Provinces (the
// province indices the assignment-with-arrows flow already draws) and the command names one in Province. The other rules and mover shapes are
// proven on synthetic fixtures. Readings and alternatives: docs/decisions/2026-09-19-hotako-yoshitada-predator-liuxeung.md.

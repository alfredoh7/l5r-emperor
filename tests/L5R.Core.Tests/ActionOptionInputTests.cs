// Issue #1028: ActionOption.RequiresInput() is the one place that says which of an option's fields mean the player must supply more than a confirm.
// A client used to keep its own list of those fields, so a field added to ActionOption was silently treated as "no input needed". This suite makes the
// decision explicit: every ActionOption property must be listed below as input-implying or not, so adding a field fails here until someone decides.

// Multi-target actions (issue #336): an ordered list of independent target slots -- each any card category or a player, each with its own
// count -- validated and offered as a whole set in one command. Proven on Doji Yoshitada (a Personality and a player), Bonds of Coin and Gold and
// Steel (one to three attachments with a 0 Gold cost), Fear Me! (a Personality, then a player only if it moved) and on synthetic fixtures for the
// shapes no card needs yet (a Holding, an enemy Personality and a player at once; up to three with none allowed; a slot naming the actor's hand).

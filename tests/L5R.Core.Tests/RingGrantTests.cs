// Two rulings by Mendon (issue #379), both checked through QueryActions the way the client sees them. See docs/decisions/2026-09-20-false-rings.md.
//   1. "Ring of Earth's battle action is an Absent Battle and may be used at any battle and may be discarded from the hand to do so." The province it names
//      is a command parameter, which QueryActions did not enumerate, so the hand play (and the in-play one) was never OFFERED enabled.
//   2. "A recruit grant at one battle is limited to that battle. If another effect grants the ability to recruit, it is only available at that battle."
//      Every Ring recruit grant carries the battle it belongs to (AdditionalActionGrant.Battle) and lapses with it.

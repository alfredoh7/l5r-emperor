// ability gets a hand-built fixture that satisfies its real preconditions, then is proved offered AND accepted in every window its printed timing allows, refused in every other
// window (a direct command is rejected with the state unchanged), and checked against its printed text with concrete state assertions. A scenario is a (phase, who acts) pair: the
// attacker/defender of a Battle phase (player 1 attacks) and the active/non-active player of an Action phase (player 0 is active).

// Mendon's four answers to the generalized Gold payment's open questions (issue #373, docs/decisions/2026-09-20-gold-payment-rulings.md), proven on the
// real cards: Virtuous Charity (the opposing player's variable payment), Disgraceful Conduct and A Stain Cleansed (prices worked from a unit's CURRENT total
// Gold cost), and At Any Cost (a dead Samurai recruited through the ordinary recruit validation, never proclaimed). Every position is explicit (the economy
// scenario, player 0 the Crane and player 1 the Lion) and driven only through QueryActions and the commands the engine offers.

// the false rings do. They should only be playable when they meet the condition and their second action that requires the ring to bow may only be used
// once it is in play." Air `oracle-l5r-10531`, Earth `10532` and Water `10535` are published; Fire `10533` and Void `10534` are not wired at all (the
// same rule applies when they are: put-into-play only, from the hand, on their condition; the second action a declared bow cost). Everything is checked
// through QueryActions, the way the client sees it. See docs/decisions/2026-09-20-false-rings.md.

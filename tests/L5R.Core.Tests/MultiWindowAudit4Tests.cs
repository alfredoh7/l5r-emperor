// Issue #830, slice 4: hand-built positions that satisfy each ability's OWN preconditions (Imperial Favor, cards in a discard pile, Rings, dishonorable targets, Kata,
// Terrain, tokens ...), which the generic MultiWindowAuditTests kitchen sink cannot. Each ability is probed in the four windows (battle as attacker, battle as defender,
// Action phase as the active player, Action phase as the other player): where its printed timing allows it, the engine must OFFER it and ACCEPT the offered command
// and the effect must match the card text; everywhere else it must be refused. The builder is called once per window with the table already in that phase.

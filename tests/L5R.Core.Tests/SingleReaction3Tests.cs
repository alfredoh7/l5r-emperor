// engine play (a purchase, an assignment, an engage, a Battle or Limited action, a revealed Event ...), proves the right player is offered it and the
// other is not, accepts it and checks the printed effect with concrete numbers/zones, then proves it is not offered (and the same command is refused)
// once the window is closed or was never opened. Gold-source Reactions ("When paying a Gold cost") are driven through a Gold-priced action in each
// window the cost can be paid in. A forged pending state is used only where the comment says no real path exists.

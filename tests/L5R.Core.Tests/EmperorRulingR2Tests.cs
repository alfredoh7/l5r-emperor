// Emperor Edition ruling pass R2 (issue #492): Mendon's ruling on the shared DELAY mechanism (src/L5R.Core/EmperorRulingR2.cs) -- an effect-recording layer (each effect an action or a duel's outcome
// applies to a card is recorded as a deferred effect keyed by the card), a store that survives phases, and appliers at each trigger point (end of battle, end of phase, end of turn, the next Dynasty
// Phase) that apply the effects in the order they were applied and negate what can no longer be applied -- and the cards built on it: Halls of the Forgotten (stronghold-wave-20), The Honor of the
// Lion, The Loyalty of the Scorpion, The Compassion of the Unicorn, The Courage of the Mantis and The Honesty of the Phoenix (strategy-wave-63), plus The Strength of the Spider's Focus Effect
// (strategy-wave-13). Every position is built explicitly and driven only through QueryActions and the commands it offers (the two store-level tests use the engine's test seams).

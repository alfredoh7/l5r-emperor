# Tutorial curriculum (issue #935)

**Where to pick this up:** the tracking issue is [#1035](https://github.com/l5r-emperor-dev/l5r-emperor/issues/1035), a checklist with one task issue per lesson. Play → Tutorial lists every lesson below; a built one starts, the rest are dimmed placeholders. Hovering or focusing an entry shows its subtitle (the part after the colon below). A long list (Level Up Your Play) scrolls with the mouse wheel or by dragging the bar at its right. The menu's own list is `src/L5R.Core/Tutorial/TutorialCurriculum.cs`: when you add a lesson, give it the same id there and in `TutorialLessons.All`.

The list was reset on 2026-10-21 by Mendon: the earlier 38-entry draft was dropped and only the first lesson kept; this is the new framework. **Everything is unlocked from the start.** Each lesson stands alone, so each brings its own table (`TutorialSetup`: decks, Stronghold, Honor, cards at home, deck tops, who goes first; see [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md)). Budget: 15-30 steps, 3-5 minutes of play, headless play-through of 2 seconds or less; stage the position instead of playing up to it.
